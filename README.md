AMB Pizza House

Title: AMB Pizza House – Healthy Superhero Pizza for Kids
This project is a fun and colorful pizza ordering app designed especially for kids. Users can choose from a variety of healthy toppings to create their perfect superhero pizza. The program collects the user's selections, calculates the total price, and displays a friendly confirmation message.

Expressions and Alerts

A small project demonstrating how JavaScript expressions and alert boxes work together to display interactive messages on the screen.

Functions

A practical exercise focused on creating and calling JavaScript functions to perform specific operations and return results.

Math Operators

This project explores basic arithmetic operators in JavaScript — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus — showing how mathematical expressions work in code.

Dictionaries

An example of how JavaScript objects can be used as dictionaries to store and retrieve key–value pairs efficiently.

Comparisons and Type Coercion

A demonstration of how comparison operators (==, ===, !=, etc.) work in JavaScript and how type coercion can influence results during logical evaluation.

Tic-Tac-Toe

The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with JavaScript. Two players take turns marking the grid, and the game announces the winner when a row, column, or diagonal is completed.

Calculator

A basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a clean, responsive interface.

              Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository.
This repository contains all the projects, challenges, and practice exercises I complete while learning JavaScript.
The goal of this repository is to track my progress, organize my code, and demonstrate my growing proficiency with JavaScript, Git, and GitHub version control.
Thank you!

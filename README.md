### AMB Pizza House  
**Title:** *AMB Pizza House – Healthy Superhero Pizza for Kids*  
This project is a fun and colorful pizza ordering app designed especially for kids. Users can choose from a variety of healthy toppings to create their perfect superhero pizza. The program collects the user's selections, calculates the total price, and displays a friendly confirmation message.

### Expressions and Alerts  
A small project demonstrating how JavaScript expressions and alert boxes work together to display interactive messages on the screen.

### Functions  
A practical exercise focused on creating and calling JavaScript functions to perform specific operations and return results.

### Math Operators  
This project explores basic arithmetic operators in JavaScript — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus — showing how mathematical expressions work in code.

### Dictionaries  
An example of how JavaScript objects can be used as dictionaries to store and retrieve key–value pairs efficiently.

### Comparisons and Type Coercion  
A demonstration of how comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, etc.) work in JavaScript and how type coercion can influence results during logical evaluation.

### Tic-Tac-Toe  
The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with JavaScript. Two players take turns marking the grid, and the game announces the winner when a row, column, or diagonal is completed.

### Calculator  
A basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a clean, responsive interface.
